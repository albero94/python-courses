In this exercise he asks to write a game, I haven't done it but I go over his recommendations for style.
He recommends the peep guide, but also makes his own suggestions.

Function style
    - Keep them small :) 

Class style
    - Don't put too much in your __init__, makes them harder to use
    - Be consistent in function arguments order
    - Try to avoid variables that come from global scope, it should be self-contained

Code style
    - Include vertical space in your code, makes it easier to read. Humans are used to it
    - If you can't read out loud, it's probably hard to read
    - Mimic styles of other people you like

Good comments
    - Code should be readable, but comments are still necessary
    - Describe why you are doing things, the code is already saying how!
    - Write docstrings for someone that would use your function
