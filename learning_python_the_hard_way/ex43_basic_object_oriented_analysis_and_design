NOT FINISHED

Really interesting section where he talks about his approach to solve problems.
Top-down and bottom-up approach.

TOP DOWN
Starts by writing the story/solution in english.
Get the nouns and verbs from the story.
Combine them and group them and start developing relationships between them
Write the possible class names, their methods, and inheritance tree
Write this in code
Small tests to try this out

Good for starters, you go from abstract concepts to detail code
Keep iterating over an over, reviewing the bigger picture every time you have
learned something by getting detailed

BOTTOM UP
More useful for experienced people that already think in code about problems
You have scattered ideas, but you are not sure how they combine
You start by writing small pieces of code, unit tests, and start building up
from there
Once you wrote a few pieces you describe in english what they are really doing
Keep iterating on this for a few times
